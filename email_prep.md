Hi Everyone,

We are very excited to host the **WiMLDS Nairobi scikit-learn open source sprint** and have you join us for a day of learning and contributing to a critical Python machine learning library!  We also think it will be day of fun and meeting new people.

The event **begins at 10am.** (Arrive early at 9:30 am for any installation or technical questions.)

## Pre-event Reminders

- Please update your RSVP if you are no longer able to attend; we have a number of people who were unable to register due to limited space.
